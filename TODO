Here is a short roadmap for SeSQL in the short/medium term :

- finalize the suggest feature ;

- optimize the sesql_admin module ;

- ease the configuration of multiple dictionnaries ;

- allow the  reindex daemon to increases/decreases  its rate according
  to the system load.

Other ides are welcomed.
