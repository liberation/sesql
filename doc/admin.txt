Django administration commands
------------------------------

syncdb
......

Django ``syncdb`` command  will create the SeSQL tables  that were not
created yet. SeSQL **must** be configured before running it.

createsqltables
...............

This command  will output  the SQL code  to create the  various tables
required by SeSQL, with ``DROP`` statements if needed.

Since there  is no support  for upgrading schemas in  SeSQL currently,
you may have  to use this command and manually edit  the output if you
do changes in SeSQL configuration.

If you have a lot of content to index into SeSQL at once, you may also
try  to create  the tables  without the  ``CREATE  INDEX`` statements,
insert the data, and then run the ``CREATE INDEX`` statements.

sesqlindex
..........

This command  takes a  class name  and an id  as parameters,  and will
reindex into SeSQL the given object.

sesqlreindex
............

This command takes only a class name as parameter, and will index into
SeSQL all  objects that exist  in Django tables  but that are  not yet
into  SeSQL. It  is very  useful  if you  just installed  SeSQL on  an
existing database.

This command may  take a long time  and use a lot of  memory.  You can
interrupt it and restart it  later on, it'll continue where it stopped
(objects are reindexed by groups  of 1000, only the current group will
be restarted).

sesqlasyncreindex
.................

This command will  reindex all your content into a  new set of tables,
allowing  for  configuration  change.  It is  devised  to  not  impact
significantly your production. It is  slightly delicate to use, and is
fully documented in its own documentation file.

sesqlupdate
...........

This  command  will  massively  reindex  a  single  (or  a  coupe  of)
column. It  will not index any new  object. Typical use is  when a new
column was added.

sesqlshortquery
...............

Perform  a short  query. The  first parameter  is a  Python expression
describing  a  Q object,  the  second,  optional  parameter, a  Python
expression specifying the sort order to use.

**Warning**  : this  command  uses ``eval()``  to  process the  Python
expressions,  it is  therefore unsafe,  and  should only  be used  for
testing purpose. Never expose this command to untrusted input.

sesqllongquery
..............

Like the previous command, but performing a long query.

sesqlfixatedate
...............

A  tool  to  recopy a  field  to  another  field  when the  target  is
NULL. Useful when a  date is only existing in some  rows, and you want
it to default to another date field, in a one-shot operation.

SQL level administration
------------------------

SeSQL contains three kinds of tables :

- The *master table* : this  table doesn't contain any actual content,
  but can be requested (with  regular ``SELECT``) to query all indexed
  content. 

- The *data  tables* : those tables  are defined in the  type map, and
  contain  the  actual content;  they  all  inherit from  the  *master
  table*.  Data  can be  inserted,  modified  and deleted  from  those
  tables.

- The  *utility tables*  :  they  are used  for  features like  search
  history  or  dependency tracking.  Refer  to  each features  for  on
  overview of its tables.
