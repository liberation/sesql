SeSQL data model guide
======================

General
-------

SeSQL data model is described in a 'config.py' file.

It should define three variables :

FIELDS
  A list (or tuple) of fields.

MASTER_TABLE_NAME
  The name of the master table to use.

TYPE_MAP
  Association between Django types and tables.

Concepts
--------

SeSQL  data model is  composed of  *fields*. A  field is  something on
which you  can perform queries and  order the data, it's  similar to a
Django field.

Fields are computed from *sources*.  A source will fetch the values to
compose a  field, taking  object attributes, concatenating  several of
them, calling methods, or following relations.

Fields
------

Each  field has  a  type, a  name, a  source  and may  have some  type
dependant options.

Known types are : 

IntField
  Normal integer field.

StrField
  Normal string field, up to 255 characters wide,``size`` can be specified.

ClassField
  Handle the class of the object.

DateField
  Date field, without time.

DateTimeField
  Date field, with time.

IntArrayField
  Field storing multi-valued integers.

FullTextField
  The beast for which !SeSQL was designed, a full-text index, can be made ``primary`` to be used in rankings.

FIXME : give example and specify options

Sources
-------

Each field requires a 'source'. The source can be one of the following classes :

SimpleField
  Will just fetch an attribute from the Django object, can specify a condition (Q object) to filter on.

MethodCaller
  Will call a method from the Django object.

SubField 
  Will walk accross one or several many-to-many mappings, fetching attributes of the related objects.

TextAggregate
  Concatenate the result of other sources.

Easy writing of sources
-----------------------

Source can also be given in a more friendly way :

- as a normal string for a ``SimpleField`` (ie, ``workflow_state``) ;

- as a normal string terminated with ``()`` for a ``MethodCaller`` (ie, ``"getFullName()"``) ;

- as a path separated by ``.`` for a ``SubField`` (ie, ``".authors.firstname"``) ;

- as a list or tuple for a ``TextAggregate`` (ie ``( "firstname", "lastname" )``).

If the source is not specified, it'll be a ``SimpleField`` of the same name that the index.

Type map
--------

The  type map is  a list  (or tuple)  of ``(class,  table_name)``. All
Django objects of this class will be indexed into the given table. All
objects of a subclass too, unless the subclass has a specific entry in
the mapping.

Example 

::

  TYPE_MAP = ((models.Photo, "sesql_photo"),
              (models.Comment, "sesql_comment"),
              (models.BaseModel, "sesql_default"))
