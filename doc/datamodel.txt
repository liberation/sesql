SeSQL data model guide
======================

General
-------

SeSQL data model is described in a 'sesql_config.py' file in the project.

It should define three variables :

FIELDS
  A list (or tuple) of fields.

MASTER_TABLE_NAME
  The name of the master table to use.

TYPE_MAP
  Association between Django types and tables.

Concepts
--------

SeSQL  data model is  composed of  *fields*. A  field is  something on
which you  can perform queries and  order the data, it's  similar to a
Django field.

Fields are computed from *sources*.  A source will fetch the values to
compose a  field, taking  object attributes, concatenating  several of
them, calling methods, or following relations.

Fields
------

Each  field has  a  type, a  name, a  source  and may  have some  type
dependant options.

Known types are : 

IntField
  Normal integer field.

StrField
  Normal string field, up to 255 characters wide,``size`` can be specified.

ClassField
  Handle the class of the object.

DateField
  Date field, without time.

DateTimeField
  Date field, with time.

IntArrayField
  Field storing multi-valued integers.

FullTextField
  The beast for which !SeSQL was designed, a full-text index, can be made ``primary`` to be used in rankings.

FIXME : give example and specify options

Sources
-------

Each field requires a 'source'. The source can be one of the following classes :

SimpleField
  Will just fetch an attribute from the Django object, can specify a condition (Q object) to filter on.

MethodCaller
  Will call a method from the Django object.

SubField 
  Will walk accross one or several many-to-many mappings, fetching attributes of the related objects.

TextAggregate
  Concatenate the result of other sources.

FirstOf
  Gets the first non-None value of a list of other sources (useful for example to tracker the creation date which is called ``created_at`` on some models and ``created_on`` on others).

Easy writing of sources
-----------------------

Source can also be given in a more friendly way :

- as a normal string for a ``SimpleField`` (ie, ``workflow_state``) ;

- as a normal string terminated with ``()`` for a ``MethodCaller`` (ie, ``"getFullName()"``) ;

- as a path separated by ``.`` for a ``SubField`` (ie, ``".authors.firstname"``) ;

- as a list or tuple for a ``TextAggregate`` (ie ``( "firstname", "lastname" )``).

If the source is not specified, it'll be a ``SimpleField`` of the same name that the index.

Type map
--------

The  type  map   is  a  list  (or  tuple)   of  ``(class,  table_name,
recursive)``. All  Django objects of  this class will be  indexed into
the given table.  All objects of a subclass  too, unless the recursive
parameter is set to False (it defaults to True).

If the same  class is reachable twice (due  to multiple inheritance or
to specifying  both a  base class  and a derivative  in the  map), the
first entry that matches is taken.

You specify  None as  the table to  explicitly ban indexing  a content
type even if a base class has to be indexed.

Example 

::

  TYPE_MAP = ((models.Photo, "sesql_photo", False),
              (models.Comment, "sesql_comment"),
              (models.BaseModel, "sesql_default"))


Dependency tracking
-------------------

SeSQL provides semi-automatic dependency tracking. This works in two steps.

1. By implementing a method ``get_related_objects_for_indexation`` on your models, which must return a lit of (classname, id) pairs (or of Django objects). This method will be called when an object is indexed. All "related objects" will then be inserted into a special table, called ``sesql_reindex_schedule``.

2. Then, asynchronously, a daemon will fetch rows from this table, and reindex objects.
