SeSQL data model guide

General
-------

SeSQL data model is described in a 'sesql_config.py' file in the project.

It should define three variables :

FIELDS
  A list (or tuple) of fields.

MASTER_TABLE_NAME
  The name of the master table to use.

TYPE_MAP
  Association between Django types and tables.

Concepts
--------

SeSQL  data model is  composed of  *fields*. A  field is  something on
which you  can perform queries and  order the data, it's  similar to a
Django field.

Fields are computed from *sources*.  A source will fetch the values to
compose a  field, taking  object attributes, concatenating  several of
them, calling methods, or following relations.

Fields
------

Each  field has  a  type, a  name, a  source  and may  have some  type
dependant options.

Known types are : 

IntField
  Normal integer field.

StrField
  Normal string field, up to 255 characters wide,``size`` can be specified.

ClassField
  Handle the  class of the  object. This  is a mandatory  field. 
  Since    version   0.12    it   accepts    an   optional    argument
  ``dereference_proxy``  which will  make SeSQL  index Django's  proxy
  models  if they  were the  underlying class.  This only  affects the
  class name,  the various methods will  still be called on  the proxy
  model.

DateField
  Date field, without time.

DateTimeField
  Date field, with time.

IntArrayField
  Field storing multi-valued integers.

FullTextField
  The beast  for which SeSQL was  designed, a full-text index,  can be
  made ``primary`` to be used in rankings.
  You  can specify  a  different text  search  configuration than  the
  default on a given FullTextField with the ``dictionnary`` parameter.

Mandatory fields
----------------

In current SeSQL version, it is mandatory to have at least :

- a ``ClassField`` named ``classname`` ;

- an ``IntField`` named ``id`` that is unique for a given ``classname``.

It is  also strongly  recommended to  have ``DateTimeField``  with the
date of indexation, defined like :

::

          DateTimeField('indexed_at', sql_default = 'NOW()')

Sources
-------

Each field requires a 'source'. The source can be one of the following
classes :

SimpleField
  Will just fetch  an attribute from the Django object,  can specify a
  condition (Q object) to filter on.

MethodCaller
  Will call a method from the Django object.

SubField 
  Will  walk accross  one or  several many-to-many  mappings, fetching
  attributes of the related objects.

TextAggregate
  Concatenate the result of other sources.

WeightedAggregate
  Allow  to ponder  the result  of  different sources  for ranking  by
  relevance. Weights  can go from A  (highest) to D (lowest).  Look at
  PosgreSQL documentation for more information on weights.

FirstOf
  Gets the first non-None value of a list of other sources (useful for
  example to track the creation date which is called ``created_at`` on
  some models and ``created_on`` on others).

Easy writing of sources
-----------------------

Source can also be given in a more friendly way :

- as a normal string for a ``SimpleField`` (ie, ``workflow_state``) ;

- as a normal string terminated with ``()`` for a ``MethodCaller``
  (ie, ``"getFullName()"``) ;

- as a path separated by ``.`` for a ``SubField`` (ie, ``".authors.firstname"``) ;

- as a list or tuple for a ``TextAggregate`` (ie ``( "firstname", "lastname" )``) ;

- a dictionary for a ``WeightedAggregate`` (ie ``{ 'A': ("firstname", "lastname"), 'B': ("nickname",) }``).

If the source is not specified, it'll be a ``SimpleField`` of the same
name that the index.

Type map
--------

The  type  map   is  a  list  (or  tuple)   of  ``(class,  table_name,
recursive)``. All  Django objects of  this class will be  indexed into
the given table.  All objects of a subclass  too, unless the recursive
parameter is set to False (it defaults to True).

If the same  class is reachable twice (due  to multiple inheritance or
to specifying  both a  base class  and a derivative  in the  map), the
first entry that matches is taken.

You specify  None as  the table to  explicitly ban indexing  a content
type even if a base class has to be indexed.

Example 

::

  TYPE_MAP = ((models.Photo, "sesql_photo", False),
              (models.Comment, "sesql_comment"),
              (models.BaseModel, "sesql_default"))


Dependency tracking
-------------------

SeSQL provides  semi-automatic dependency tracking. This  works in two
steps.

1. By implementing  a method ``get_related_objects_for_indexation`` on
your models, which  must return a lit of (classname,  id) pairs (or of
Django  objects).  This  method  will  be called  when  an  object  is
indexed. All  "related objects" will  then be inserted into  a special
table, called ``sesql_reindex_schedule``.

2. Then, asynchronously, a daemon will fetch rows from this table, and
reindex objects.


Cleanup in text fields
----------------------

Before indexing text  fields, cleanup has to be  performed.  In SeSQL,
the cleanup is a two-phase process.

The first phase is user-configurable. It  should strip the text of all
meta-information (HTML tags, wiki syntax, ...) and gives plain text.

The second phase  is automatic, it consists in  stripping all accents,
converting  upper-case letters  to  lower-case  letters and  replacing
special characters with spaces.

To configure the first phase, you have two options :

1.  Specify the  ``ADDITIONAL_CLEANUP_FUNCTION`` in  the configuration
file.  This  should  contain  a  function, which  takes  the  text  as
parameter and returns the cleaned up text.

2.  Add  a ``cleanup``  parameter  to  the ``FullTextField``,  with  a
similar function.

The  ``ADDITIONAL_CLEANUP_FUNCTION``   will  be   used  only   if  the
``cleanup`` parameter was not specified, or set to None.

Additional text search configurations
-------------------------------------

If you want  additional text search configurations to  be created when
SeSQL  tables   are  created,  you  can   add  the  SQL  lines   in  a
ADDITIONAL_TS_CONFIG variable  in the config file.  Refer to PosgreSQL
documentation for more details.
