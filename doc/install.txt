SeSQL installation guide
========================

Prerequisite
------------

- Django 1.1

- PostgreSQL 8.4

FIXME

Installation
------------

SeSQL is a standard Django application.  Just drop it in the ``apps/``
directory, and add it into ``settings.py`` .

Configuration
-------------

Before using SeSQL you **must** configure it. The configuration file
is named ``config.py``.

The details of the configuration are in the FIXME file.

The options that are required to get SeSQL working are the following :

TS_CONFIG_NAME
  Name of the *text search configuration* to create and use in the
  PostgreSQL database.

STOPWORDS_FILE
  Name of the stopwords file. This file **must** be where PostgreSQL
  will look for (``/usr/share/postgresql/8.4/tsearch_data/``) and
  **must** only contain plain ascii characters. An example command to
  generate the file for the french language is :

::

   LC_ALL=fr_FR.UTF-8 iconv -f utf-8 -t ascii//TRANSLIT \
   /usr/share/postgresql/8.4/tsearch_data/french.stop > \
   /usr/share/postgresql/8.4/tsearch_data/ascii_french.stop

CHARSET
  Name of the charset to use. Note that SeSQL was only tested in utf-8.

FIELDS
  A list or tuple of fields (see ``datamodel.txt``), including at
  least ``classname`` and ``id``.

MASTER_TABLE_NAME
  The name of the master table, from which all others will
  inherit. This table should not contain any data, but a query done to
  it will query all SeSQL tables.

TYPE_MAP
  This list of ``(class, table)`` couples describes the mapping of
  Django classes to SeSQL tables. Django classes not present in the
  list will not be indexed by SeSQL. Subclasses will, by default, be
  sent to the same table of the superclass.

CROSS_INDEXES
  This list contains all additional indexes to create in the
  database. Each index is just a list of column. Indexes that are
  worth creating depend of the kind of queries you do frequently.

SKIP_CONDITION
  A function (or lambda) that is called on every object, is not
  ``None``. If it returns a true value, the object will not be
  indexed. Useful, for example, to filter on workflow state.

DEFAULT_ORDER
  Default sort order for queries, when sort order is not specified.


Constraints
-----------

Current version of SeSQL has a few constraints :

- it  requires to  have a  ``ClassField`` called  ``classname``  and a
  ``IntField`` called ``id``, referring to the object class and id ;
