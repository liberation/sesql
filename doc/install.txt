SeSQL installation guide
========================

.. contents:: :depth: 2
.. sectnum:: :depth: 2

Prerequisite
------------

- Python 2.5 or 2.6

- Django >= 1.2 (or SQLAlchemy, see sqlalchemy.txt)

- PostgreSQL >= 8.4

- GenericCache from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/GenericCache/1.0.2

SeSQL may  work with  later versions  of those  software, but  was not
tested with them.

Installation
------------

SeSQL is a standard Django application.  Just drop it in the ``apps/``
directory, and add it to enabled applications into ``settings.py`` .

Generating stop word files
--------------------------

What is this about ?
....................

SeSQL needs to be able to filter out stop words from the indexed text,
for performances reasons.  Stop words  are words like "a", "the", "is"
in  English, or  "il",  "le", "les"  in French,  which  will occur  in
(almost) every text and does not carry any significant information.

PostgreSQL provides stop  words files for common  languages, but those
files can contain accentuated characters,  like "été" in French. Since
SeSQL strips all  accentuated characters from indexed  text, they will
not work directly.

You need to use one of the following three methods.

Automatic conversion
....................

A script is now included with SeSQL, in the ``scripts/`` directory, to
automatically convert all the stop words files provided by PostgreSQL. 

Please note that  this script has to be executed  as root, since it'll
have to write in PostgreSQL data directory.

Just run, as root, ``scripts/generate_stop.sh``. It'll ask you for the
directories  to   handle  (by  default,  it'll   handle  all  standard
PostgreSQL installations)  and languages to handle  (by default, it'll
handle all of them).

Generated files will be named ``ascii_<language>.stop``.

Manual conversion
.................

Alternatively,  you  can convert  one  (or  more) stop  words  file(s)
manually, with a command (as root)  like (for the French language, and
PostgreSQL 8.4) :

::

   LC_ALL=fr_FR.UTF-8 iconv -f utf-8 -t ascii//TRANSLIT \
   /usr/share/postgresql/8.4/tsearch_data/french.stop > \
   /usr/share/postgresql/8.4/tsearch_data/ascii_french.stop

Provide a manual file
.....................

If your language isn't  included, or if you want to  use a custom stop
words list, you can  provide any text file, with a  word on each line,
as long  as it  is in  the appropriate  directory and  doesn't contain
accentuated or other kind of special characters.

Configuration
-------------

Before using SeSQL  you **must** configure it.  The configuration file
must  be named  ``sesql_config.py`` in  the python  path (usually  the
project).

For a summary  of how to quickly configure SeSQL,  please refer to the
tutorial.  This document  contains a  detailed list  of all  recognized
options.

ORM choice
..........

Since  version  0.10,   SeSQL  can  work  with   non-django  ORM.  See
sqlalchemy.txt for more informations about it.

Text search configuration
.........................

PostgreSQL's full text search is based  on the concept of *text search
configuration*  (TSC).   Those  configuration   are  detailed  on  the
PostgreSQL manual, and  allow to control things  like stopwords. SeSQL
requires a default TSC, and can  support additional TSCs to be used on
specific indexes.

SeSQL  recognizes  the  following   options  related  to  text  search
configuration :

TS_CONFIG_NAME
  Name of  the primary  *text search configuration*  to create  in the
  PostgreSQL database and use in full text fields where a specific TSC
  is not specified.

STOPWORDS_FILE
  Name of the stopwords file. This file **must** be where PostgreSQL
  will look for (``/usr/share/postgresql/8.4/tsearch_data/``) and
  **must** only contain plain ascii characters. See above for how to
  generate them.

ADDITIONAL_TS_CONFIG

  This should be  a list of SQL statements, to  define extra TSCs that
  can be used in specific fields.

Clean-up/filters
................

CHARSET
  Name  of the  charset to  use. Note  that SeSQL  was only  tested in
  utf-8. SeSQL will store all data in plain ASCII, the charset will be
  used for preprocessing, cleanup and conversion.

ADDITIONAL_CLEANUP_FUNCTION
  This function (usually a lambda, but not necessarily) will be called
  to process text  both at indexation and search time.  It can be used
  for example to  remove html tags or convert entities  back to normal
  letters.
  
SKIP_CONDITION
  A function (or lambda) that is called on every object, is not
  ``None``. If it returns a true value, the object will not be
  indexed. Useful, for example, to filter on workflow state.

Indexes and fields
..................

FIELDS
  A  list or  tuple of  fields (see  ``datamodel.txt``), including  at
  least ``classname`` and ``id``.

CROSS_INDEXES
  This  list  contains  all  additional   indexes  to  create  in  the
  database. Each  index is  just a  list of  column. Indexes  that are
  worth creating depend of the kind of queries you do frequently.

Types and tables
................

MASTER_TABLE_NAME
  The  name  of   the  master  table,  from  which   all  others  will
  inherit. This table should not contain any data, but a query done to
  it will query all SeSQL tables.

TYPE_MAP
  This list  of ``(class,  table)`` couples  describes the  mapping of
  Django classes  to SeSQL tables.  Django classes not present  in the
  list will not  be indexed by SeSQL. Subclasses will,  by default, be
  sent to the same table of the superclass.

Query parameters
................

DEFAULT_ORDER
  Default   sort  order   for  queries,   when  sort   order  is   not
  specified. Should be  a tuple of index names, with  an optional - to
  indicate reverse order.

DEFAULT_LIMIT
  The default number of items returned by a short query.

SMART_QUERY_INITIAL, SMART_QUERY_THRESOLD, SMART_QUERY_RATIO
  Control of the smart query heuristic.

QUERY_CACHE_MAX_SIZE
  Maximal number  of long  query to  store in  the query  cache. Older
  queries  will be  discarded  first.   The cache  is  used to  ensure
  stability of paginated results, and avoid redoing the search on very
  page.

QUERY_CACHE_EXPIRY
  Maximal time to store long queries in the cache.

Reindexing daemon
.................
DAEMON_DEFAULT_CHUNK
  Number of elements to proceed on each iteration of the reindex daemon.

DAEMON_DEFAULT_DELAY
  Delay, in seconds, between two chunks.

DAEMON_DEFAULT_PID
  Pid file to use for the  reindex daemon. The user running the daemon
  must have write permission to it, and the directory must exists.

ASYNCHRONOUS_INDEXING
  If set  to True, all  indexing will be  forwarded to the  daemon for
  asynchronous   indexing.  Locking   will   then  not   be  used   in
  indexation.  This  is  recommended  behavior if  you  have  frequent
  changes in  your database, and can  tolerate a few minutes  of delay
  between modification of the database and the results being reflected
  in SeSQL.

  This is only supported with Django ORM for now.

Search history and statistics
.............................

HISTORY_DEFAULT_FILTER
  Queries giving less  than this amount of results will  be ignored in
  history.
  
HISTORY_ALPHA = 0.95
  Erode  factor for  time-based decay  of recent  searches score.  The
  closer to 0,  the faster old searches will see  their score go down,
  the closer to 1 the longer they'll remain with high scores.

HISTORY_BETA
  Weight of  the frequency at  which the  search was performed  in the
  final score. This is on an  arbitrary scale, and is only meaningfull
  compared to the HISTORY_GAMMA parameter.

HISTORY_GAMMA
  Weight of the number of results given by the query in the final score.

HISTORY_BLACKLIST
  A list of queries that will be ignore by the history feature.

Additional features
...................

ENABLE_SESQL_ADMIN
  If set to  yes, you'll be able to use  ``sesql:<fieldname>`` in your
  admin  options classes  to  search on  SeSQL  indexes from  Django's
  admin. Please note  that this feature reallies on  a monkey-patch of
  core Django code, and is therefore disabled by default.


Constraints
-----------

Current version of SeSQL has a few constraints :

- it  requires to  have a  ``ClassField`` called  ``classname``  and a
  ``IntField`` called ``id``, referring to the object class and id ;

- since all  data is  converted to plain  ASCII internally,  it'll not
  work   out-of-the-box   with    languages   written   in   non-latin
  script. Patches are welcomed to handle that.

Upgrading
---------

If you need to rebuild all SeSQL indexes (because you changed them too
heavily for example) you can do :

::

  ./manage.py createsesqltables | ./manage.py dbshell
  ./manage.py sesqlreindex
