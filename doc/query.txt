Writing SeSQL queries
=====================

.. contents:: :depth: 2
.. sectnum:: :depth: 2

Short queries and full queries
------------------------------

SeSQL can be queried in two modes : *short queries* and *full queries*.

Short queries
.............

Short queries are designed to retrieve a small amount (like 50) recent
(according to  any date field  indexed by SeSQL) content  matching the
given criteria in an extra-fast manner.

It's typical used for a portlet, infobox or similar widget.

It has several limitations :

- it doesn't count the total amount of content matching the query ;

- it must be used on a query sorted by a date field ;

- several optimizations will be disabled if the content types spawn on
  more than one SeSQL table (see the typemap).

Full queries
............

Full  queries  (sometimes  called  *long   queries*  in  the  code  or
documentation) are a  more common search.  They are a  bit slower than
short queries, especially  if there is a lot of  content matching, but
propose additional features :

- exact count of matching items ;

- stable pagination support  (even if content is  inserted or modified
  between the  query and  when the page  is displayed,  the pagination
  will remain stable) ;

- support of sorting  by relevance, if the query  includes a full-text
  search.


General rules
-------------

Making queries  with SeSQL  is made by  calling the  ``shortquery`` or
``longquery`` function with a Django Q object.

All the  general rules of  Q objects  still work :  using ~ to  make a
negation, | to make OR queries, & to make AND queries.

The kind of supported queries depend of the index types.

Queries by type
---------------

IntField
........

- default is = (``id = 12`` for ``id == 12``);

- ``__lt``, ``__gt``, ``__gte``, ``__lte`` for <, >, <=, >=  (``id__lt = 12`` for ``id < 12``) ;

- ``__in`` to test if it's inside a list (``id__in = (12, 13)``) ;

- ``__range=(min,max)`` to test if it's inside the range (``id__range = (12, 42)``)

StrField
........

- default is = (``workflow = "published"``);

- ``__in`` to test if it's inside a list (``workflow__in == ("published", "pending")``) ;


ClassField
..........

- default is = (``objclass = Article``);

- ``__in`` to test if it's inside a list (``objclass__in == (Article, Photo)``) ;

DateField
.........

- default is = (``date = now()`` for today);

- ``__lt``, ``__gt``, ``__gte``, ``__lte`` for <, >, <=, >=  (``id__lt = now()`` for before today) ;

- ``__range=(min,max)`` to test if it's inside the range.

DateTimeField
.............

- like DateField, only different for ordering.

IntArrayField
.............

- default is contains (``authors = 12`` for contains the author 12) ;

- ``__all`` for contains all of a list (``authors__all = (12, 13)`` for contains both authors) ; 

- ``__any`` for contains any of a list (``authors__any = (12, 13)`` for contains at leats one of the two authors) ; 

FullTextField
.............

- ``__containswords`` to test for inclusing of all the given words (``fulltext__containswords = "presidential elections in france"``) ;

- ``__containsexact`` to test for a specific sentence (``fulltext_containsexact = "france 2"``) ;

- ``__matches`` to test with a !PostgreSQL full-text query string (which can contain & for and, | for or, ...) (``fulltext_matches = "presidential | legislative & elections"``) ;

- ``__like`` to match with a SQL like (``fulltext_like = "fra%"``).


Sorting with SeSQL
------------------

Problematics
............

SeSQL needs the sort order to perform various optimization. It must be
known early in the process of deciding which heuristics to use.

General syntax
..............

The sort order  must be given as a  second, optional, 'order' argument
of the methods. For example 

::

   shortquery(Q(classname__in = ('Article', 'PaperPage')) & 
              Q(fulltext__containswords = 'python postgresql'), 
              order = ( '-publication_date', 'page' ))


The ``order`` argument must be a list of field names, on which sorting
makes sense  (you can't sort of  full text indexes for  example). If a
field  is prefixed  by "-"  it'll use  a descending  order  (defaut is
ascending order).

Special ordering
................

SeSQL support special ordering modes, prefixed by ``sesql_``. Only one
is implemented in this version :

sesql_relevance
  will sort  by relevance of the  full text query on  the primary full
  text index.  Will only work  if the query  includes a filter  on the
  primary full text index. Will disable most heuristics, so be careful
  to not overuse it.

Default order
.............

 The default search order is taken from the ``DEFAULT_ORDER`` varibale
 in ``config.py``.
