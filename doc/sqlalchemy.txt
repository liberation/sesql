==========================

.. contents:: :depth: 2

Introduction
------------

Since version 0.10, SeSQL can be  used with other ORM than Django, for
example  SQLAlchemy.   Not  all  features  are   supported,  and  this
considered beta status.

Design
------

The SQLAlchemy  version is designed  to work with  different databases
for core  data and SeSQL data.  It can be two  PostgreSQL database, or
PostgreSQL for  SeSQL and something  else (was tested with  Sqlite and
MySQL) for the core data.

How to
------

To use SQLAlchemy with SeSQL you need to do three things :

1. Configure SeSQL to use SQLAlchemy, rhat will look like :

::

 #
 # Select the ORM to use
 #
 from sesql.orm.alchemy import AlchemyOrmAdapter
 orm = AlchemyOrmAdapter()


2. Bind  your ``AlchemyOrmAdapter``  with your program  bootstrap code
(to have it access its  database, your sessionmaker for "normal data",
and to create SeSQL tables if required), with something like :

::

 Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
 sesql_config.orm.bind('postgresql:///sesql', Session)
 sesql_config.orm.sync_db()

3. Express your queries with the ``Q`` object from ``sesql.orm.alchemy``.

Limitations
-----------

1. You **need** to manually call ``sync_db`` at a point.

2. The management commands are not supported. 

3. The SearchHistory feature is not supported.

4. SQLAlchemy bulk operations are not supported.
