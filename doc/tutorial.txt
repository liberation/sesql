How to install and configure SeSQL ?

Introduction
------------

This small tutorial  should guide you to install SeSQL  on an existing
Django project.

First step : install prerequisite
---------------------------------

If you  have a running  Django instance, you  should have most  of the
prerequisite for SeSQL. You only have to do two things :

1.   Ensure   that  you're   using  PostgreSQL   8.3  or   above  (8.4
preferred). If  you are using  another RDMS,  SeSQL will not  work. It
should be  possible to  use PostgreSQL for  SeSQL tables,  and another
engine for the rest of data, but it is not supported by this tutorial.

2.  Install  GenericCache   from  pypi  or  from   Debian  packages  :
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/GenericCache/1.0.2 .

Second step : install SeSQL
---------------------------

Installing SeSQL  is simple : it's  just a Django application.  Add it
alongside with your others Django applications, and then add it to the
``INSTALLED_APPS`` list in your ``settings.py`` file.

Third step : configure SeSQL
----------------------------

This is the only slightly tricky part.

Create a configuration file
...........................

SeSQL will import its  configuration file with ``import sesql_config``
statements. So it  should be somewhere in  your ``PYTHONPATH``, called
``sesql_config.py``. The best  place to put is  usually alongside with
the ``settings.py`` file.

To create it, the best is to copy the ``config.py.sample`` file (which
is  provided  with  SeSQL)   as  ``sesql_config.py``  on  your  chosen
location.

If you are in Django project, you can define an alternative module from
where to load the ``sesql_config``, useful when you cannot alter your
``PYTHONPATH``, with this setting in your project configuration: ::

  SESQL_CONFIG_PATH = 'my_app.sesql_configuration'

Adjust the text search configuration
....................................

The sample configuration file is tuned for the french language. If you
want to use another  language, replace french inside ``simple_french``
and ``ascii_french`` for  ``TS_CONFIG_NAME`` and ``STOPWORDS_FILE`` by
the name of the language you want to use.

Provide a stopwords file
........................

PostgreSQL (and therefore SeSQL) requires a stopwords file. Stop words
are words like "the", "a", "of", ... in english, that should be ignore
in searches because they are too frequent to have any value.

You've two ways to generate this stopwords file :

1. Your language is among those  handled by PostgreSQL. Then, you have
   a file called ``<language>.stop``  in your PostgreSQL installation;
   for     example     on     Debian    it     would     be     inside
   ``/usr/share/postgresql/8.4/tsearch_data/``. In that case, you just
   need to  create a plain ASCII  version of the file,  with a command
   line:

  ::

    LC_ALL=fr_FR.UTF-8 iconv -f utf-8 -t ascii//TRANSLIT \
    /usr/share/postgresql/8.4/tsearch_data/french.stop > \
    /usr/share/postgresql/8.4/tsearch_data/ascii_french.stop


2. Your language  isn't supported by PostgreSQL. In  that case, you'll
   need to  write the stopwords file  yourself, just put one  word per
   line, in pure ascii.


Create the type map
...................

The type map has two purposes : select which models to index and which
to ignore,  and to group  models that are  often searched at  the same
time for better performances.

If you're not  sure about it, you  can just index all  models into one
big table. That should work very well unless you have several millions
of rows in your  database. If you have such a  high volume, you should
consider having a finer type map.

The simplest type map possible would look like:

::

 from django.db import models
 TYPE_MAP = ((models.Model, "sesql_default"),)

Define your fields
..................

Then you  need to define  your fields (that  is, the indexes  on which
you'll  query and/or  sort SeSQL).  This is  done with  the ``FIELDS``
variable.

The  first   two  items   of  the   sample  configuration   file,  the
``classname`` and ``id`` ones, are required and should be kept as they
are.

For the rest, adjust the fields on  the example to match what you want
to index. Refer to the datamodel documentation for details.

Fine-tune configuration
.......................

Now, you can adjust other  parameters of the configuration file. Refer
to the install documentation for more details on  various options you
can tweak.

Forth step : reindex your content
---------------------------------

Once everything is  ready, it is very  simple, and can be  done in two
commands :

1. ``./manage.py syncdb`` to create all SeSQL tables ;

2. ``./manage.py sesqlreindex`` to reindex  the content. That step can
take  a  long time  if  you  have lots  of  content,  but if  it  gets
interrupted, it'll restart where it was.

Fifth step : test queries
-------------------------

Use ``./manage.py shortquery`` and/or ``./manage.py longquery`` to
perform queries, like :

::

 ./manage.py shortquery 'Q(my_index__containswords="a small sentence")'

Sixth step : integrate SeSQL with your code
-------------------------------------------

Now,  you  can  integrate  SeSQL in  your  code,  calling  shortquery,
longquery.
