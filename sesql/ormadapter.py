Oh, hum, this is a kind of very simple meta-ORM. It allows SeSQL to
work with different ORMs...

This is an abstract class that must be subclassed for each ORM

Even if it is not part of the OrmAdapter class, the OrmAdapter is
responsible of cathing signals and hooking itself to call the
index/delete functions as required
